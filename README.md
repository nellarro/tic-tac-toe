# tic-tac-toe

###Week 3 weekend assignment of the Iron Yard.

The assignment was to make a simple tic-tac-toe game.

Did not realize at the time that tic-tac-toe is not a simple game to program. Kudos to video game programmers!

This is when CSS started to make sense a little bit more to me. The imagery in this game is really beautiful. Beach themed!

**JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3**
